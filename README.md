This project is to divide the workload of the monte carlo algorithm over multiple pc's.

Please make a file called config.json that is in the same directory as this readme file. To see how this config file should look, please see configtemplate.json.
If a single or more items from the config file are missing the defaults that are set in ConfigData.java will be used.
Please refrain from changing those defaults in the java file, to prevent pushing public ip's or passwords to the git repository.
